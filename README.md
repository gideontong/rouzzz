# rouzzz

rouzzz is an alarm clock that acts dynamically, created in order to alert you moments before you are scheduled to leave in order to arrive at calendar events on time based on current and predicted traffic conditions. It's purpose is to ensure you get the maximum amount of sleep possible.

We are looking into possibly adding additional features, like sleep cycles in the future.

rouzzz is built with [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) and can be run in development mode using the following set of commands:

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

You can build the app for release on iOS with the `--configuration Release` runtime flag, or `--variant=release` runtime flag for Android exports.
